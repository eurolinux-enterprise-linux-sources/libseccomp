libseccomp: An Enhanced Seccomp (mode 2) Helper Library
===============================================================================
http://libseccomp.sf.net

The libseccomp library provides and easy to use, platform independent,
interface to the Linux Kernel's syscall filtering mechanism: seccomp.  The
libseccomp API is designed to abstract away the underlying BPF based syscall
filter language and present a more conventional function-call based filtering
interface that should be familiar to, and easily adopted by application
developers.

* Documentation

The "doc/" directory contains all of the documentation aside from the README
file (this file) and the LICENSE file which can be found in the top level
directory.

* Building and Installing the Library

In order to build the library you should follow the familiar three step
process used by most applications:

	# ./configure
	# make [V=0|1]
	# make install

As usual, running "./configure -h" will display a list of build-time
configuration options.

* Testing the Library

There are a number of tests located in the "tests/" directory and a script
which can be used to help automate their execution, "regression".  If you want
to run all of the tests you can simply run the script:

	# ./configure
	# make
	# cd tests
	# ./regression

However, the script takes a number of options to customize its execution; the
options can be displayed by running "./regression -h".

* Other Useful Tools

The "tools/" directory includes a number of tools which may be helpful in the
development of the library, or applications using the library, but for various
reasons are not installed by default.
